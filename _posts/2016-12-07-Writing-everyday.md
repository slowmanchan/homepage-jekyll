<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he night is old (ancient even) and I can't sleep yet again.  So what do I do? I read of course!  what better way to lull the mind to sleep then to read.  I've been reading [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware By: Andy Hunt](https://www.amazon.ca/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Wetware/dp/1934356050).  Its filled with ideas on how to improve your learning capability and problem solving falculties.  It can be read by anyone but it is geared toward programmers.  It explores the two sides of the brain, commonly referred to as the left and right side of the brain.  The left side responsible for logic and reason and the right side responsible for spatial reasoning and creativity.  Hunt aptly sums this up as:

>**the L-mode is like seeing the trees instead of the forest, the R-mode, the opposite.**

We tend to focus on our _L-mode_ (the left side) more often because of the way our education system works.  Logic and reasoning is king among our studies but Hunt says that this is a error.  We should harness our other side, the R-mode to see the bigger picture and gain a holistic perspective.  He says we should practice and one of the things that I've been doing is writing.  Writing everday, as soon as one gets up, is supposed to spark the R-mode into action, before the L-mode takes over.  Dump your thoughts, massacre with lead and raize that paper battlefield.  It is difficult because he recommends three whole pages but he mentions that they don't have to be coherent or readible by others.  It is ment to be a mind dump to try and harness the R-modes thoughts and capture them on your canvas.  

>_**"massacre with lead and raize that paper battlefield"**_

Dreams are an indication of our R-mode hard at work.  Because R-mode lacks verbal acuity, it has hard time expressing itself (a younger me can relate).  Dreams therefore, act as a conduit for R-mode to unleash the ideas built up throughout the day, week or even year.  Thats one of the reason why dreams are so vivid yet fleeting; R-mode can't tell us whats up, it can only rapidly fire off sensational images that you cannot process with your waking mind.  

So you may be thinking, whats the use?  Why even bother learning about the equivalent of that emo-kid in high school that no one could ever understand and thought was weird (in other words, me).  Hunt says that we can and should use R-mode as much as we can and the only way to do so is block L-mode at times.  Giving L-mode a mundane task such as washing your dishes or talking to your girlfriend (or boyfriend) allows R-mode free reign over your thoughts.  Its like looking at one of those magical pictures from the 90's.  Like this one:

![magic picture](http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_640x430/public/how-do-magic-eye-pictures-work1_5.jpg)

You can only **see** the picture behind the picture if you lose your focus and just look unfocused.  The goal is to not focus in and blur your vision.  Thats kind of how R-mode works; unfocus your thoughts, free it from the rational and let your mind wander.  Thats how you can harness the power of **R**.  Free **R** from the tyranical dictator that is **L** and you will gain  masterful insight into your mind.

I leave you with a related and hilarious comic:
