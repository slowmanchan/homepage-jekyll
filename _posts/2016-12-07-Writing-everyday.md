I've been reading [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware By: Andy Hunt](https://www.amazon.ca/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Wetware/dp/1934356050).  Its filled with ideas on how to improve your learning capability and problem solving falculties.  It can be read by anyone but it is geared toward programmers.  It explores the two sides of the brain, commonly referred to as the left and right side of the brain.  The left side responsible for logic and reason and the right side responsible for spatial reasoning and creativity.  Hunt aptyl sums this up as:
>the left is like seeing the trees instead of the forest, the right, the opposite.

We tend to focus on our L-mode (the left side) more often because of the way our education system works.  Logic and reasoning trump is king among our studies but Hunt says that this is a error.  We should harness our other side, the R-mode to see the bigger picture and gain a holistic perspective.  He says we should practice and one of the things that I've been doing is writing.  Writing everday, as soon as one gets up, is supposed to spark the R-mode into action, before the L-mode takes over.  Dump your thoughts, massacre with lead and raize that paper battlefield.  It is difficult because he recommends three whole pages but he mentions that they don't have to be coherent or readible by others.  It is ment to be a mind dump to try and harness the R-modes thoughts and capture them on your canvas.

I will be posting some samples of my R-dump and let us see what is revealed.
