Jekyll is easy right? if you found yourself struggling with this tech, youre not alone!

Heres what people say:

* You don't have to worry about a database
* Its mostly just static pages
* A template for a personal blog is made automagically with: {% highlight ruby %}jekyll new myblog{% endhighlight %}
* Its got some ruby mixed in there
<!--more-->

Now I'm not a complete newbie when it comes to coding.  I have made full working sites with ruby on rails and react but I found myself challenged more so then my expectation of the challenge.

I'm not afraid to say that I found it harder then what people made it out to be.  

Liquid is weird (the templating language not the watery substance...).  I mean look at this:

    {% raw %}{% assign foo = "bar" %}{% endraw %}

Assign? Was var or variable or just using the name unavailable?

Learning new things is hard, even if people find the tech simplistic simply because we are trying to understand a new paradigm.  We have to learn new ways of reading syntax, coercing logic and generally making sense of things.  I'm confident now that I can work with jekyll, having gone through the trials and tribulations but it wasn't easy and don't let anyone tell you that.

Next up, a tutorial on Jekyll!

Keep on hackin!
