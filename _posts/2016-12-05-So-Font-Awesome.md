Ever wonder how sites like _github_ and _twitter_ have some of the best looking icons for everything?! Its because of the hard work from the people at *Font Awesome*.  They've created a whole library of high quality, scalable icons for almost everything you need an icon for and the best part is, they're absolutely *free*!  

You can just grab the [CDN link](http://fontawesome.io/#modal-download) and paste it into your head! (your site head lol) or you can [download](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/) the files and include it in your site directory.  

To use it, use \<i\> tags and insert the class name of the icon you want to use, like this:

{% highlight html %}
<i class="fa fa-github"></i>
{% endhighlight %}

And you will get this: <i class="fa fa-github"></i>

Since they are vector graphics, you can scale them as big as you want and they wont lose picture quality.  You can color them just like fonts and add fancy transitions as well.

They even include a [search-widget](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) so you can locate that square facebook icon you've always been dreaming about!
