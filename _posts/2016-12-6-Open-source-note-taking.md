Taking notes is essential to generating great ideas.  Big ideas are built on the smallest of ideas.  Keeping a note pad is great but if you'r looking to go digital then their are a ton of options out there.  Evernote, Google keep and One note are just a few great choices.  If you like the idea of having as much open-source in your life as possible (like me) then check out Laverna.

#### Laverna

Laverna is an open source platform for note taking similar to evernote but without all the extra features.  Its simple an has all of the essentials. You can search through notes, make note books and favorite notes.  Its free and hosted on lavernas servers, unlike alternatives such as paperwork.  

Markdown is supported which is a major plus for me as I prefer to work with it.  It even features the ability to encrypt your notebooks which is lacking from the other options.  Performance is much better then evernote due in part to the lack of features.

The design is simple, flat with muted colors, similar to material design.  

If a no frills note taking app is what youre looking for, then try out [Laverna](http://laverna.cc)
