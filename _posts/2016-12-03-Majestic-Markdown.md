Today I want to talk about this thing called Markdown.  You've probably used it on Stack overflow, Github, Jekyll or Reddit.  Its designed to be easy to read and its really easy to use.

Basically, it converts your super plain text into HTML markup.  You type in:
{% highlight jekyll %}
# Heading
{% endhighlight %}
turns into this HTML:
{% highlight HTML %}
<h1>Heading</h1>
{% endhighlight %} or this on your screen:

> # Heading

Easy right? So you can have fancy headers, **bold** and organized lists and [highlighted links](http://www.example.com)!

You _can't_ do colours or change font types but its really meant just for the display of text.

I wanted to write a simple tutorial but instead I've compiled a list of resources I've used to learn Markdown in **one** afternoon.

Once you've mastered the art of markdown, you to, will be a master at composing _README.md_ or posting awesome looking posts on Stack overflow!
