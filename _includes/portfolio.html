        Listed are my best pieces of work that highlight my current web development skill set. Please take your time and browse around!
      </p>

        The first one, CalcJS, is a toy app that I created to get a feel for the Jquery.  It demonstrates my ability to learn and apply that knowledge quickly and efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project Spark is a prototype that I am working on currently using Ruby on Rails.  The goal is to allow people to post the projects they work on and get feedback and help from others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two works, Odin book and Toronto Mesh are full projects that I've created to get the full experience of the technology(Ruby on Rails and Jekyll).  Odin book displays the culmination of all the web technologies I have learned.  Toronto Mesh is a site that I currently work on and volunteer my time with.
