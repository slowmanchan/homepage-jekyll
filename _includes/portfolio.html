          Listed below are my best pieces of work that highlight my current web development skill set. Please take your time and browse around!

        <p>
          The first two, CalcJS and DoItMan are toy apps that I created to get a feel for the respective technologies(JQuery and Ruby on Rails).  They demonstrate my ability to learn and apply that knowledge quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last two works, Odin book and Toronto Mesh are full projects that I've created to get the full experience of the technology(Ruby on Rails and Jekyll).  Odin book displays the culmination of all the web technologies I have learned.  Toronto Mesh is a site that I currently work on and volunteer my time with.
